here E represent error codes
**Rule 1: Access Control and Authentication**
- E22:accessing systems and applications. Implement mechanisms to prevent duplicate usernames and passwords.
- E5: Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for sensitive systems and data to enhance security. Require an additional verification step beyond the username and password.
- E26: Set up a mechanism that locks user accounts after a specific number of failed login attempts. Once locked, users should be directed to a process for account recovery.
- E28: Enforce a regular password change policy, such as changing passwords every 60 days, to ensure ongoing security of user accounts.
- E655: Develop a process to promptly deactivate or revoke access for employees who have left the company to prevent unauthorized access.

**Rule 2: Data Protection and Encryption**
- E52: Implement encryption protocols (e.g., SSL/TLS) to ensure that sensitive data is encrypted during transmission. Use secure channels for data exchange.
- E40: Store personal identifiable information (PII) in a secure and restricted-access environment. Implement role-based access controls to limit who can access PII.
- E14: Regularly rotate encryption keys and update certificates to maintain the security of encrypted data. Set up reminders for key and certificate rotations.
- E13: Regularly monitor and renew certificates to avoid using outdated certificates that may compromise data security.

**Rule 3: Network Security**
- E66: Configure firewalls to block unauthorized inbound traffic based on predefined rules and policies. Implement intrusion detection and prevention systems to detect and mitigate suspicious activity.
- E67: Conduct regular vulnerability assessments and penetration tests to identify weaknesses in the network infrastructure and address them promptly.
- E68: Schedule regular security assessments to identify and remediate network vulnerabilities. Use automated tools to help identify potential weaknesses.
- E67: Regularly conduct thorough penetration tests to identify any overlooked vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers.

**Rule 4: Patch Management**
- E78: Establish a patch management process to ensure timely installation of security patches for all software and operating systems. Automate patch deployment whenever possible.
- E31: Conduct regular vulnerability scans to identify systems that require patching. Implement automated vulnerability scanning tools to streamline the process.
- E49: Ensure that patch installations are tested in a controlled environment before deployment to production systems to avoid disruptions.
- E6: Set up a patching schedule and follow it consistently to ensure that security updates are applied promptly.

**Rule 5: Incident Response**
- E23: Develop a comprehensive incident response plan that outlines steps to be taken during security breaches. Assign responsibilities and communication channels for incident response team members.
- E57: Conduct regular tabletop exercises to simulate security incidents and test the effectiveness of the incident response plan. Identify areas for improvement and refine the plan accordingly.
- E70: Establish clear containment measures in the incident response plan to isolate and minimize the impact of security breaches. Update these measures based on lessons learned from previous incidents.
- E876: Develop a detailed recovery strategy that includes steps for restoring systems and data to normal operation after a security breach. Test this strategy through simulated exercises.

**Rule 6: Employee Training and Awareness**
- E65: Provide comprehensive training on identifying phishing attempts, suspicious emails, and malicious links. Regularly update employees on evolving phishing tactics.
- E87: Educate employees about social engineering tactics and encourage them to verify requests for sensitive information before sharing.
- E11: Conduct regular security awareness programs to ensure that employees are aware of security best practices for handling data and using company systems.
- E9: Develop and deliver a comprehensive security training program that covers various attack vectors and provides practical tips for maintaining security.

**Rule 7: Vendor and Third-Party Risk Management**
- E65: Establish a vetting process for evaluating third-party vendors' security practices before sharing sensitive information or granting system access.
- E75: Regularly assess third-party vendors' security measures to ensure they meet your company's standards. Implement periodic security reviews.
- E73: Implement strict access controls and encryption mechanisms when sharing sensitive data with third parties. Limit data access to only what is necessary.
- E86: Create a contractual agreement with third-party vendors that includes security obligations and responsibilities, specifying how security risks will be managed.
